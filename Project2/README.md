This is a project on a maze traversal of a maze size 5x7 2d array. each element of the array is a Bird object that points to a certain direction. The direction indicates that we can hop to any element along that direction. There is a start Bird and an end bird. The solution to the maze consist of traversing all possible jumps of each bird until end Bird is reached. There are 2 solution files, first one is an iterative method of traversing, the second solution is a recursive solution.
